        <h2>2 Nephi 2:14-16</h2>
        <p>
            14 And now, my sons, I speak unto you these things for your profit and learning; for there is a God,
            and he hath created all things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are,
            both things to act and things to be acted upon.
        </p>
        <p>
            15 And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man, after he had created our first parents,
            and the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are created,
            it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other bitter.
        </p>
        <p>
            16 Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself.
            Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other.

        <h2>Alma 5:40-42</h2>
        <p>
            40 For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil.
        </p>
        <p>
            41 Therefore, if a man bringeth forth good works he hearkeneth unto the voice of the good shepherd,
            and he doth follow him; but whosoever bringeth forth evil works, the same becometh a child of the devil,
            for he hearkeneth unto his voice, and doth follow him.
        </p>
        <p>
            42 And whosoever doeth this must receive his wages of him; therefore, for his wages he receiveth death,
            as to things pertaining unto righteousness, being dead unto all good works.
